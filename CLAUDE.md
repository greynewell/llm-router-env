# Claude Software Factory — Claude Instructions

This repo is the factory itself. It is a GitHub Actions template that autonomously
implements, reviews, and merges code. It improves itself via the same loop it provides
to users.

## Pull Requests

Always create PRs using `gh pr create`. Never substitute a compare link.

```
gh pr create \
  --repo OWNER/REPO \
  --title "..." \
  --body "..." \
  --base main \
  --head <branch>
```

Always run this as the final step. The PR must exist before marking the task complete.

## Issues

When creating a GitHub issue, always include `@claude` at the end of the body so the
workflow auto-triggers. Example closing line:

```
@claude please implement this
```

## Development

This repo contains only GitHub Actions YAML and shell scripts. There is no compiled code.

- Validate YAML: `find .github/workflows -name '*.yml' -exec python3 -c "import yaml,sys; yaml.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))" {} \; && echo "All YAML valid"`
- No build or test commands required beyond YAML validation

Before committing, confirm all workflow YAML is syntactically valid.

## Self-Improvement Loop

The factory runs on itself:
1. `claude-proactive.yml` (hourly) and `claude-self-improve.yml` (weekly) scan for issues
2. Issues trigger `claude-auto-assign.yml` → `claude.yml` implements them
3. `claude-code-review.yml` reviews the PR
4. `claude-pr-shepherd.yml` merges when CI passes
5. `auto-tag.yml` tags the release
6. Repeat

When filing improvement issues, be specific about which workflow file, what line or
behavior to change, and why it improves the factory.
