            You are the Claude Software Factory scanning itself for improvements. This repo IS
            the factory — its workflows are the product. Improving them is the primary goal.

            Check existing open issues first to avoid duplicates:
              gh issue list --state open --limit 50

            Scan in two passes:

            **Pass 1 — Factory self-improvement** (highest priority):
            Read every file in .github/workflows/ and CLAUDE.md. Look for:
            - Workflow prompts that are ambiguous, incomplete, or could be sharper
            - Missing error handling or edge cases (shepherd merging too eagerly, etc.)
            - New workflows that would close gaps in the loop (dependency updates, changelog,
              security scanning, performance regression, notification hooks, etc.)
            - Ways to make the self-loop tighter (concurrency, retry logic, bot triggers)
            - CLAUDE.md instructions that are unclear or missing

            **Pass 2 — General codebase issues**:
            - Logic errors, race conditions, unhandled exceptions
            - Security vulnerabilities or hardcoded secrets
            - TODO/FIXME comments representing real work
            - Dead code or unused files

            For each finding, file an issue:
              gh issue create --title "..." --body "...specific file, current behavior, desired behavior...\n\n@claude please implement this"

            File at most 3 issues per run. Prioritize factory self-improvement over general bugs.
            Zero issues is fine if nothing concrete warrants attention.
